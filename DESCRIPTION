Title: Estimation of per-position bias in high-throughput sequencing
        data
Description: This package implements a model of per-position sequencing
        bias in high-throughput sequencing data using a simple Bayesian
        network, the structure and parameters of which are trained on a
        set of aligned reads and a reference genome sequence.
